# INFO201

This course introduces fundamental tools and technologies necessary to transform raw data into information. 
In doing so, I learn how to write code to work with data. 
The course covered skills associated with each component of the information lifecycle, including the collection, storage, analysis, and visualization of data. 
Core competencies underlying this process, including data wrangling, version control, and command line proficiency, are acquired through real-world data-driven challenges.
This course has prepared me to be able to apply these data-skills to my field of interest, or pursue higher level informatics courses.
Here are the assignments and group final project that I have completed during my time in INFO201.

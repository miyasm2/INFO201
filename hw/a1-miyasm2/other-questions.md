# Git Commands
The purpose of this file is for you to demonstrate your knowledge of working with the terminal (because we can't otherwise know which commands you entered in the terminal). Think of it as a way to document the code that you used in the terminal to perform the assignment. Following each prompt below, write the line of code that you would (did) use on the terminal to accomplish the task. You can then use this file as a reference for your own work.

```bash
# Print your working directory
pwd
# List the files in your current directory
ls
# Change your directory to a folder in which you do work for this class
cd info201
# Clone your assignment repository from GitHub to your machine
git clone https://github.com/info-201a-sp20/a1-miyasm2
# Using a *relative path*, change your directory to inside the repository you just cloned

cd a1-miyasm2
# Make a new folder called "imgs" - you'll download an image into this folder
mkdir "imgs"
# Add all of your changes that you've made to git
git add .
# Make a commit of your changes, including a descriptive message
git commit -m "completed other-questions"
# Push your change up to GitHub
git push
```

# Finding Cheat Sheets

A cheet sheet is a website (or document) that has a list of commonly used commands for a program or programming language.

This is a link of cheat sheet provided by my TA: https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf


Search Google for *git cheat sheets*, look through several, and choose your favorite. Below copy the URL of your favorite one and below it write a sentence explaining why that one was your favorite.

This is a link to my favorite cheat sheet I found:  https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/

This is my favorite one because it helped me learn to make a table, which I needed for a lecture exercise. Overall it has the basic syntax needed as well as some really good extended syntax. Along with external links for greater detail on each of the elements.

## Topic

#### Hate Crimes

## Domain of interest
**Why are you interested in this field/domain?**

We are interested in hate crimes because of the rising rate of hate crimes against Asian Americans due to COVID-19. Throughout history, it has become clear that due to certain tragic events, the race, religion, sexual orientation, or other groups, that seem closely related to those events are ridiculed to hate crimes. For example, after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Japanese Americans suffered ridicule and hate crimes well after the war ended. We are interested to see in more detail a possible correlation between the key points in a historical tragedy and hate crimes against the related parties.

**What other examples of data-driven projects have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?**

The [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/hatecrimes/hate-crime-statistics) released data on victims of hate crime incidents, based on gender, race/ethnicity/ancestry, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, and disability in the year of 2018. The data shows a comparison of the hate crimes of 2018 to 2017, as well as a methodic breakdown of the offense by crime category, known offenders, and location type.
A study done by [The Marshall Project](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2019/11/26/why-police-struggle-to-report-one-of-the-fastest-growing-hate-crimes) discusses why people hesitate to report hate crimes in the first place. Therefore allowing the hate crimes to spread until they become too much to contain for local law enforcement officials.
Research and data collection done by [Quartz](https://qz.com/843834/are-hate-crimes-really-on-the-rise-in-america-heres-a-guide-to-the-data/) reveal if hate crimes are really on the rise in America. Quartz gave clear breakdowns from different sources such as the FBI,  The Southern Poverty Law Center’s, and much more, on how the data was collected, the time period covered, and lastly what the data showed.

**What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?**

- Which areas of the US have the highest hate crime rates?
- Which race is targeted with hate crimes? Which religions? What are the correlations between income inequality and hate crime rates?
- What is the correlation between the key points in a historical tragedy and hate crimes against the parties (gender, race, religion)?

## Finding Data

**Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?**

We downloaded data from one of [Github’s](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/hate-crimes) many databases, specifically data from FiveThirtyEight, to see if higher rates of hate creams are tied to income inequality.
We used another one of [Github’s](https://github.com/emorisse/FBI-Hate-Crime-Statistics/tree/master/2013) databases, that showed reports of hate crimes within jurisdictions in 2013.
The [FBI](https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2018/tables/table-1.xls) provided us statistics on hate crimes during 2018, more specifically the incidents, offenses, victims, and known offenders.
Our last data download was also from the [FBI](https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2018/tables/table-12.xls) it again provided us with the statics of hate crimes during 2018, but this time it focused on the agency hate crime reported by state and federal. FBI has multiple data sets about hate crimes including locations of hate crimes and different types of date crimes.

**How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?**

- (GitHub/FiveThirtyEight hate crimes) This data was collected through multiple sources, the FBI and Southern Poverty Law Center, Kaiser Family Foundation, Census Bureau, and the United States Elections Project. All to ascertain if there is a correlation of hate crimes due to income.
- (FBI Reports of hate crime) This data was collected from the FBI through their records. It consists of the number of hate crimes reported to the FBI by jurisdiction over the span of 4 quarters in 2013.
- (General hate crime summary) This data was collected by the FBI and shows different hate crime statistics for bias motivations such as race, religion, sexual orientation, disability, and gender.
- (Hate crime reports by state) This data was collected by the FBI and shows the number of hate crimes submitted to the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program by law enforcement agencies from each state in 2018.

**How many observations (rows) are in your data?**

- (GitHub/FiveThirtyEight hate crimes) There are 52 observations in the data.
- (FBI Reports of hate crime) There are 1827 observations in this data set.
- (General hate crime summary) There are 43 observations in the data set.
- (Hate crime reports by state) There are 58 observations in this data set.

**How many features (columns) are in the data?**

- (GitHub/FiveThirtyEight hate crimes)  There are 12 features in the data.
- (FBI Reports of hate crime) There are 15 features in this data set.
- (General hate crime summary) There are 5 features in the data set.
- (Hate crime reports by state) There are 5 features in this data set.

**What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?**

- (GitHub/FiveThirtyEight hate crimes)  From this dataset, we can see how higher rates of hate crime can be tied into income inequality, and even more specifically into: citizens vs. noncitizens, unemployed vs. employed, white vs. nonwhite and so on.
- (FBI Reports of hate crime) Through this data set, we can answer which state/jurisdiction has the highest number of reported hate crimes as well as the demographics behind them.
- (General hate crime summary) We can answer which races and religions are targeted the most with hate crimes and we can use it to help answer the correlation between historical events in 2018 to different genders, races, and religions.
- (Hate crime reports by state) From this data set, we can answer questions about which states reported the most/least incidents of hate crimes. Furthermore, we can answer questions about the percentage of law enforcement agencies in each state that submitted reports.
